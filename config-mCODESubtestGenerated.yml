# List of locations holding profile StructureDefinitions to be used for profile validation
# May be a web url, a relative file, or a relative directory (profiles in sub-directories not included)
# StructureDefinitions loaded from this configuration setting take precedence over StructureDefinitions 
# accessed from canonical URLs in TestScripts that resolve to StructureDefinitions. 
# This allows for validation against unpublished versions of profiles.
